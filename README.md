# odin-recipes

Through this beginner project assigned by The Odin Project, I made a rudimentary blog site of recipes and learned to commit to making consistent webpage designs as well as making regular Git comments. This presented me with a greater contextual understanding of the processes behind web development.

I practiced using the HTML elements I was taught and followed the instructions to the best of my comprehension.
